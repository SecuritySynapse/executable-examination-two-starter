# TODO: The imports in the following source code block may no longer

# You must reorganize and/or add the imports so that they adhere

# Introduction: Read This First! {{{

# Keep in mind these considerations as you implement the required functions:

# --> You must implement Python functions to complete each of these steps,
# bearing in mind that one defective function may break other function(s).

# --> Your source code must adhere to industry best practices in, for instance,
# source code formatting, variable naming, and documentation.

# --> You may refer to the checks that are specified in the exam/gatorgrade.yml file
# in this GitHub repository for the configuration and name of each tool used
# to analyze the code inside of this file.

# Instructions: Implement and/or debug the following functions so that they
# adheres to all aspects of the following specification.

# Function specification for count_print_functions_malware_analysis:
# The function count_print_functions_malware_analysis should:
# --> Take as input the parameter source_code that is a string
#     consisting of valid Python source code that can be parsed and run.
# --> Produce as output an integer that represents the number of times
#     that the print function call is found inside of the source code.
# --> If the source code does not contain the print function call, then
#     the function should return 0.
# --> If the source code contains the word "print" but it is not a function
#     call, then it should not be counted.

# The overall purpose of the count_print_functions_malware_analysis function
# is that it could be used during malware analysis to find debugging statements
# inside of a malware sample. This could perhaps help the malware analyst to
# determine if the malware is being debugged or not. The final question part
# in this file will further develop and explore this idea of malware analysis.

# TODO: This function may not not have all of the correct type annotations for
# certain variables. You must add all of any needed type annotations
# so that the function and any code that uses it passes the type checker.

# TODO: This function may not have a docstring and thus it may not adhere
# to industry best practices for Python source code. You may need to add a docstring
# so that this function is correctly documented by an software engineer using it.

# Function specification:
# The function count_words_cryptanalysis should:
# --> Take as input the parameter called text that is a string
#     consisting of any valid words represented by ASCII or Unicode characters.
# --> Produce as output a dictionary of key value pairs such that:
#    - The key is the word found in the text
#    - The value is the number of times that the specific word was found in the text

# The content in the dictionary could be used as one of the data points that
# would support the cryptanalysis of a text that was encrypted. You can think of
# this function as performing a type of "frequency analysis" on the text.
