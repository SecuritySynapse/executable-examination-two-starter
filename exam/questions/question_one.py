# Introduction: Read This First! {{{

# Keep in mind these considerations as you implement the required functions:

# --> You must implement Python functions to complete each of these steps,
# bearing in mind that one defective function may break other function(s).

# --> Your source code must adhere to industry best practices in, for instance,
# source code formatting, variable naming, and documentation.

# in this GitHub repository for the configuration and name of each tool used

# Instructions: Implement and/or debug the following functions so that they

# Function specification for encrypt_caesar_cipher:
# The function encrypt_caesar_cipher should:
# --> Take as input the parameters:
#   - plaintext: a string that represents the plaintext to be encrypted
#   - shift: an integer that represents the shift to be applied
# --> Produce as output a string that represents the encrypted text
# --> The output string will be encrypted using a Caesar cipher with the provided shift,
#     This means that the cipher will take a letter in the plaintext and shift it
#     by the shift amount to produce that specific letter in the output ciphertext.

# Function specification for decrypt_caesar_cipher:
# The function decrypt_caesar_cipher should:
# --> Take as input the parameters:
#   - ciphertext: a string that represents the ciphertext to be decrypted
#   - shift: an integer that represents the shift to be applied
# --> Produce as output a string that represents the decrypted text
# --> The output string will be decrypted using a Caesar cipher with the provided shift,
#     This means that the cipher will take a letter in the ciphertext and shift it
#     by the shift amount in the opposite direction (of the encryption algorithm) to
#     produce that specific letter in the output plaintext.

# The following property should hold for all inputs:
# --> The original plaintext should be equal to the output of
#     decrypt_caesar_cipher(encrypt_caesar_cipher(plaintext, shift), shift).
# --> In other words, the decryption of the encryption of the plaintext
#     should be equal to the original plaintext.
# --> In other words, the decryption algorithm should "undo" or "reverse"
#    the encryption algorithm.

# Instructions: Implement the following functions so that they adhere to all

# Function specification:
# The function encrypt_latin_alphabet should:
# --> Take as input the parameter called text, which is a string
# --> Produce as output a string that represents the encrypted
#     text using the Latin alphabet cipher
# --> The Latin alphabet cipher will encrypt each letter in the
#     plaintext with the corresponding number of the letter in the
#     alphabet. For example, the letter "A" will be encrypted to "1",
#     the letter "B" will be encrypted to "2", and so on.
# --> If there is a non-alphabetic letter in the plaintext, this
#     function should leave it unchanged in the output ciphertext. This
#     means that if there is a space, number, or symbol in the plaintext,
#     it should be left unchanged in the output ciphertext.
# --> This function should only work with upper-case letters in
#     the English alphabet. This means that if it sees a lower-case
#     letter it should convert it to upper-case before encrypting it.

# Function specification:
# The function decrypt_latin_alphabet should:
# --> Take as input the parameter called text, which is a string
# --> Produce as output a string that represents the decrypted
#     text using the Latin alphabet cipher
# --> The Latin alphabet cipher will decrypt each number in the
#     ciphertext with the corresponding letter of the alphabet. For example,
#     the number "1" will be decrypted to "A", the number "2" will be decrypted
#     to "B", and so on.
# --> If there is a non-numeric character in the ciphertext, this
#     function should leave it unchanged in the output plaintext. This
#     means that if there is a space, letter, or symbol in the ciphertext,
#     it should be left unchanged in the output plaintext.
# --> This function should only work with numbers representing
#     upper-case letters in the English alphabet. This means that the
#     decrypted letters should be in upper-case.
